## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login → Redirected to Replit Auth
2. OIDC callback → Session created in PostgreSQL
3. User data synchronized with local database
4. Frontend receives user context via protected API

### Activity Lifecycle
1. User creates activity → Validated against Zod schema
2. Activity stored with creator reference
3. Real-time notification to all trip members
4. Members respond (accept/decline) → Updates participant count
5. Personal calendars updated automatically

### Real-time Updates
1. WebSocket connections established per client
2. Activity changes broadcast to all trip members
3. Frontend state updated without page refresh
4. Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
